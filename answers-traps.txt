1. Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf?
a0-a7存放函数调用传递的参数，13是main中传给printf的第三个参数，因此放在寄存器a2中。

2. Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g? (Hint: the compiler may inline functions.)
实际上并没有真正地去调用函数f，以内g和f非常简单，编译器直接将f和g的调用展开了。

3. At what address is the function printf located?
在call.asm中查找printf，发现在0x6bc，由call.c程序与库文件链接而来。

4. What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main?
jal将下一条指令的地址存入ra，因此在执行jalr后ra的值为li a0, 0的地址0x34。

5.  question
What is the output?
    HE110 World
The output depends on that fact that the RISC-V is little-endian. 
If the RISC-V were instead big-endian what would you set i to in order to yield the same output?
    将i调整为0x00726c64
Would you need to change 57616 to a different value?
    57616作为一个十六进制整数值输出不需要修改。

6. In the following code, what is going to be printed after 'y='? (note: the answer is not a specific value.) Why does this happen?
额，这题有点莫名其妙，会出现编译错误，因为缺少参数。
